There is a popular SSRN paper floating around the quant world from some big names in the industry.
You can find the paper here: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4631351

I am faily sceptical about claims such as:

> Our findings reveal that an initial investment of $25,000 in the VWAP Trend Trading strategy with QQQ would have grown to $192,656, net of commissions, yielding a 671% return. This performance is marked by a maximum drawdown of just 9.4% and a Sharpe Ratio of 2.1.

My personal opinion is that profitable research on trading strategies is extremely unlikely to be made public.  I have attempted to recreate this paper's methodology with QuantConnect.

**TLDR:** 
I do not know why this is a published paper.  If my logic is wrong, please raise a PR.
